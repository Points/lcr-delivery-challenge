# Assignment
Build a single-page storefront using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript that is styled to match the provided design, and that dynamically displays the provided JavaScript data.

## Instructions
- Timebox your project to at maximum *four hours*, however you can submit earlier -- it's not necessary that you finish, just get as much done as you can.
- If any part of the requirements are unclear, reach out to your contact at Points.
- Upload your project to your personal Github profile and share the link with your contact at Points. Alternatively, you can share a zipped (compressed) folder of the relevant project files.

## Requirements
- Code your storefront to match the provided design: "wdps_challenge__design.png"
- Please refrain from using tools or libraries e.g. jQuery, Bootstrap
- The design does not surface the CSS e.g. font, spacing, etc. so you're expected to interpret these specifications in the design to the best of your ability.
- Use default cross-browser fonts, like Arial, Verdana, Georgia.
- Code for modern browsers, don't worry about IE11.
- Code using accessibility best practices.
- Code using responsive design best practises.

### Functionality
- Use the contents of the provided JavaScript file cardData.js and display that data into the 1x3 cards grid, include the functionality:
    - Add UI control above the cards to filter cards by type: buy, gift, or transfer, and render the corresponding data type properties into each card.
    - Extra: Add UI control above the cards to sort card options by lowest to highest cost, and highest to lowest.
- In the payment form, use placeholder copy for default dropdown option.
- In the Order Summary aside, dynamically render the selected card's data as values for elements "Total miles" and "Total cost".
